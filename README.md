## [Homework 1.)](Homework1-RGB)
- Task: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue.This control must leveraged igital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer‚Äôs value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## [Homework 2.)](Homework2-Elevator)
- Task: Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform. Each floor has a coresponding button and LED. The elevator has a buzzer and an LED to indicate its operational state.

## [Homework 3.)](Homework3-7segment)
- Task: Use the joystick to control the position of the segment and ‚Äùdraw‚Äù on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through ‚Äùwalls‚Äù. Upon pressing the joystick button the current LED lights up, upon holding the joystick button for more than 2 seconds everything resets. Starting position is the decimal point.

## [Homework 4.)](Homework4-Stopwatch)
- Task: Use a 4 Digit 7 Segment Display and a Shift Register to implement a stopwatch timer that counts in 10ths of a second and has a start/stop, reset and save lap functionality (similar to most basic stopwatch functions on most phones).

## [Homework 5.)](Homework5-InteractiveMenu)
- Task: Develop a ‚ÄùSmart Environment Monitor and Logger‚Äù using Arduino. This system will utilize various sensors to gather environmental data, log this data into EEPROM, and provide both visual feedback via an RGB LED and user interaction through a Serial Menu.
