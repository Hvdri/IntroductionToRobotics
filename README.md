## [Homework 1.)](Homework1-RGB)
- Task: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue.This control must leveraged igital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## [Homework 2.)](Homework2-Elevator)
- Task: Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform. Each floor has a coresponding button and LED. The elevator has a buzzer and an LED to indicate its operational state.
