# Homework #2 - RGB Led controlled by 3 potentiometers, each one for each color.

## Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- 3 potentiometers
- 1 RGB Led
- 3 resistors 
- wires

## Implementation details
- The 3 potentiometers are connected to the Arduino Uno board, each one to an analog pin (A0, A1, A2).
- The RGB Led is connected to the Arduino Uno board, each color to a digital pin (9, 10, 11).
- The 3 resistors are connected to the RGB Led.
