## Task - RGB Led controlled by 3 potentiometers, each one for each color.
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green and Blue.This control must leverage digital electronics.Specifically, you need to  read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- 3 potentiometers
- 1 RGB Led
- 3 resistors 
- wires

## Implementation details
- The 3 potentiometers are connected to the Arduino Uno board, each one to an analog pin (A0, A1, A2).
- The RGB Led is connected to the Arduino Uno board, each color to a resistor, then to a digital pin (9, 10, 11).
- The code then calculates the rotation of each potentiometer into the value of brightness for its respective color (A0 - 9, A1 - 10, A2 - 11).
